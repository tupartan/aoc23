# Advent Of Code 2023 - Let's see how far I get this time
## Day 0
### Hello to me
My name is Tuomas and I am a software tester. I have been testing for a living about 20 years now and I have seen quite many different kinds of setups. Agile, Waterfall, large enterprise software programs, embedded mobile phone development programs, have been a developer, tester, manager, customer support, trainer, a powerpoint man, ... 

One thing I have really enjoyed, but never mastered, is programming. Sure I can create whatever Object Oriented Programming lessons from school had taught me, but I always end up with hundreds of lines of code where masters of code can do with tens of lines of code (and even though I see their code, it is usually quite incomprehensible). But as a stubborn finnish man, I still pursue to improve my coding skills and challenge myself.

I have started this AoC once, or twice, never really finishing. Last time I tried with Python. I guess now I have some hours still to decide between Python, Java or JavaScript. So my goal is to finish. I can be last no matter, but getting to the end would be nice.

## Day 1
### Good morning and good night
So my puzzle solving begins. First things first is to remind myself (google) of basics. I was suprised how quickly I was able to remember and churn the puzzle with Python so maybe it is like riding a bike. After a few falls and bruises I buried the first puzzle. But the second part, ... phew..., test inputs did not uncover a flaw in my approach and before I figured which input row was not interpreted correctly, I was able to get the right answer. Maybe google helped me to find rows behaving badly. Just before midnight.

## Day 2
### Coding in the middle of the forest
Today I was able to jump in to this only in the later afternoon. In addition to my day job I have a hobby, or some might call it a  profession, which obligates me to be in the middle of forest once or twice a year. Luckily I have pretty decent accommodation and good wifi so I have a good setup for solving todays puzzle. Coding parts today were simple and straight forward; rules of the puzzle were not, so first part of the puzzle took more time than it needed, but second part was easy and no need to stay until midnight.
