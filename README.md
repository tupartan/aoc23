# Advent Of Code 2023 - Let's see how I get this time
## Day 0
### Hello to me
My name is Tuomas and I am a software tester. I have been testing for a living about 20 years now and I have seen quite many different kinds of setups. Agile, Waterfall, large enterprise software programs, embedded mobile phone development programs, have been a developer, tester, manager, customer support, trainer, a powerpoint man, ... 

One thing I have really enjoyed, but never mastered, is programming. Sure I can create whatever Object Oriented Programming lessons from school had taught me, but I always end up with hundreds of lines of code where masters of code can do with tens of lines of code (and even though I see their code, it is usually quite incomprehensible). But as a stubborn finnish man, I still pursue to improve my coding skills and challenge myself.

I have started this AoC once, or twice, never really finishing. Last time I tried with Python. I guess now I have some hours still to decide between Python, Java or JavaScript. So my goal is to finish. I can be last no matter, but getting to the end would be nice.
