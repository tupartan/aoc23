# Advent Of Code 2023 - Let's see how far I get this time
## Day 0
### Hello to me
My name is Tuomas and I am a software tester. I have been testing for a living about 20 years now and I have seen quite many different kinds of setups. Agile, Waterfall, large enterprise software programs, embedded mobile phone development programs, have been a developer, tester, manager, customer support, trainer, a powerpoint man, ... 

One thing I have really enjoyed, but never mastered, is programming. Sure I can create whatever Object Oriented Programming lessons from school had taught me, but I always end up with hundreds of lines of code where masters of code can do with tens of lines of code (and even though I see their code, it is usually quite incomprehensible). But as a stubborn finnish man, I still pursue to improve my coding skills and challenge myself.

I have started this AoC once, or twice, never really finishing. Last time I tried with Python. I guess now I have some hours still to decide between Python, Java or JavaScript. So my goal is to finish. I can be last no matter, but getting to the end would be nice.

## Day 1
### Good morning and good night
So my puzzle solving begins. First things first is to remind myself (google) of basics. I was suprised how quickly I was able to remember and churn the puzzle with Python so maybe it is like riding a bike. After a few falls and bruises I buried the first puzzle. But the second part, ... phew..., test inputs did not uncover a flaw in my approach and before I figured which input row was not interpreted correctly, I was able to get the right answer. Maybe google helped me to find rows behaving badly. Just before midnight.

## Day 2
### Coding in the middle of the forest
Today I was able to jump in to this only in the later afternoon. In addition to my day job I have a hobby, or some might call it a  profession, which obligates me to be in the middle of forest once or twice a year. Luckily I have pretty decent accommodation and good wifi so I have a good setup for solving todays puzzle. Coding parts today were simple and straight forward; rules of the puzzle were not, so first part of the puzzle took more time than it needed, but second part was easy and no need to stay until midnight.

## Day 3
### Not funny
Seven minutes before midnight I solved this. After a weekend in the middle of the forest, I was looking forward to relax and enjoy a peaceful evening. Sod it. I was determined to solve today's puzzle, but even though with valid approach, extensive testing, fixing and testing, fixing I finally got there with first puzzle. It took me a lot of time. Luckily second part was just minor adjustements (krhm. hacks) so still, but barely, in target. Good night.

## Day 4
### Logic vs. efficiency
Today was the first coding tasks that hinted that my code should be efficient rather than meeting my standards for logic. Second part of the puzzle took few seconds to run, I got the right answer at first try, but previous attempts with aocs' have taught me that in puzzles to come I need to learn new tricks especially producing more efficient code. I asked from ChatGPT, but even though attempts were made, I don't think code performance was more efficient when compared to my solution. Then checked reddit for alternative solution and found a one made with 9 lines of code (mine was about 50) and boy it was fast. So human beat the AI.
